Dental App GUI
==============

Created in MANGT656 - Systems Analysis and Design at Kansas State University.

Simple front end design for a web app that dental hygienist could use to track patients appointments and medical information. Not quite fully featured, but its simply a proof of concept. The primary purpose of the project was to learn requirements gathering techniques and the steps that go into the Planning and Analysis phases of the SDLC. The idea was that this HTML model could be linked to a back-end database using PHP/Python/Ruby/Perl.

The model is simply a front-end, no functionality is tied to it. But we can take this back to our clients (the dental office) and receive feedback early in the development process. AGILE!
